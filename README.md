# gitops
Over the weekend I built a small Kubernetes-based microservice deployed via GitOps using Argo CD. I containerised a Go API, deployed it to a local Kubernetes cluster, exposed metrics, and managed deployment state declaratively through Git. This allowed me to practise core Kubernetes primitives, GitOps workflows, and CI-driven container builds.
